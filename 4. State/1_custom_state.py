# For adding a custom state to the agent, we need to pass a dictionary to the session_state parameter of the Agent class.
# This dictionary will automatically be saved in the storage. Note the memory only stores the user data.
# Try saying the following to see the memory and session working together:
    # My name is Parth Chawla and for breakfast I drink milk.
# RESTART THE SESSION TO SEE THE MEMORY PERSIST
    # Hey
    # Do u have my favorite products available
# This will likely show you that Milk is available.

# You can ask it to add Milk to your cart and then show the cart contents.
# You can also clear your preferences by just saying it: Can you clear my preferences please and also clear my name.

# Once the dictionary is passes inside the session_state, we will need to just pass the agent: Agent instance to the tools that require it, such as add_item_to_cart and show_cart.

# After which we manipulate the state using the agent.session_state dictionary.

# In case where u dont wanna use any values from the state inside the prompt(instructions) or in description it can be available by setting the add_state_in_messages parameter to True.

# The limitation is that since it is not a defined parameter, you cannot use it as a variable to pass through some function to keep the instruction at a different place, It should be passed just like a placeholder in the instruction string, and it will be replaced automatically by the agent at runtime.


# The state will be persist in the database:
# You can check the state by running the following command:
    # sqlite3 tmp/state.db
    # SELECT * FROM agent_sessions WHERE session_id = '004';
# Here you will be able to find that on each initialization the system prompt is initialized and the total_price is set.
# The session_state dict is at the end and the state persists.

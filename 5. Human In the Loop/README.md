# Human In the Loop (HITL) Module

This module provides practical patterns and examples for integrating human feedback or approval into agent workflows. Human-in-the-loop (HITL) is essential for critical actions, safety, and quality control in agentic systems.

## Overview

This module covers:

- Requiring user confirmation before executing important actions (e.g., deleting data, making payments)
- Pausing agent execution and waiting for human input
- Designing safe, auditable approval flows for sensitive operations

## Getting Started

Each script in this module demonstrates a different HITL pattern. To use, simply run the desired script with your Python environment:

```bash
python <script_name>.py
```

## Scripts & Examples

- `1_user_confirmation.py`: Basic pattern for requiring user confirmation before proceeding with an action.
- `2_toolkit_confirmation.py`: Example of integrating HITL into a toolkit of agent tools.
- `3_user_input.py`: Demonstrates pausing agent execution to collect arbitrary user input.
- `4_external_execution.py`: Shows how to require external (human) approval before executing critical actions.

## Features

- HITL (Human-in-the-Loop) agent patterns
- User confirmation and approval flows
- Safe execution of critical actions
- Modular, extensible examples for real-world agentic systems

## Usage

Use these patterns to add human approval steps to your agents, ensuring safety and compliance for sensitive operations. Adapt and extend the examples as needed for your own workflows.

# 🧠 Memory Module

> **Purpose:**
>
> This module shows you how to give your AI agents a "memory"—so they can remember things from earlier in a conversation, across sessions, or even about specific users. Memory is what makes agents feel smart and personal!

## 👶 What is Agent Memory?

Just like people, agents can be much more helpful if they remember what you said before. This module teaches you different ways to add memory to your agents, from simple built-in options to more advanced, custom solutions.

## 📂 What's Inside?

- **1_built_in_memory.py**  
  Shows how to use the Agno framework's built-in memory features. Great for getting started quickly!

- **2_session_storage.py**  
  Demonstrates how to store information for the duration of a session (like a chat or a workflow). Useful for keeping context while the user is active.

- **3_user_memory.py**  
  Example of giving each user their own memory, so the agent can remember preferences or facts about them across sessions.

- **4_session_summary.py**  
  Shows how to summarize a session's memory, making it easier for the agent to recall important points without storing everything.

## ✨ Why Use Memory?

- Make conversations feel more natural and less repetitive
- Personalize responses for each user
- Enable agents to handle complex, multi-step tasks
- Summarize long conversations for quick recall

## 🚦 How to Use These Examples

1. **Pick a file** that matches the kind of memory you want (see above).
2. **Read the comments** in the code—they explain what each part does.
3. **Run the script** with Python:
   ```bash
   python 1_built_in_memory.py
   # or
   python 2_session_storage.py
   ```
4. **Experiment!** Try changing what the agent remembers, or add your own facts.

## 📝 Tips for Beginners

- Start with `1_built_in_memory.py` if you're new—it's the simplest.
- Don't worry if you don't understand everything at first. Read the comments and try running the code.
- Memory can be as simple or as advanced as you want. You can always add more features later!
